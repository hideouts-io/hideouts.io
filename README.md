# hideouts.io

Source for [hideouts.io](https://hideouts.io), the home of the open-source macOS and iOS privacy and security apps and research published at [github.com/hideouts-io](https://github.com/hideouts-io).

It's a static [Astro](https://astro.build) site. Project pages are generated from each repository's README at build time, so GitHub stays the source of truth: update a README and the site follows on the next build.

- **Only allowlisted repositories are published.** See [The allowlist](#the-allowlist).
- **Dark by default.** The site ignores the device's light/dark setting and always opens dark; the header toggle switches to light and remembers that choice in the browser only.
- **No tracking and no third-party requests.** No analytics, no cookies, no external fonts or images. README images are copied onto the site at build time.
- **Strict Content Security Policy.** Scripts and styles are allowed by hash only, with no `unsafe-inline`.

## Local development

Requires Node 24 or later (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc); `nvm use` picks it up).

```sh
npm ci
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)   # optional locally, required in CI
npm run content                        # fetch + render the allowlisted repos
npm run build                          # build dist/ and the search index
npm run verify                         # allowlist + internal link checks
npm run preview                        # serve dist/ at http://localhost:4321
```

Run everything CI runs (except the external link check) with:

```sh
npm test    # lint, format check, type check, build, allowlist + link checks
```

`npm run dev` also works for editing layouts, but the production build is the only way to test search and the Content Security Policy.

Generated files (`.cache/`, `src/generated/`, `public/media/`, `public/og/`, `src/styles/shiki.generated.css`) are git-ignored and rebuilt on every CI run.

### When GitHub is unavailable

The fetch step never leaves a half-written cache: each repository downloads into a temporary folder and replaces the old copy only when it's complete. If the API fails for a repository that has a cached copy (locally, or restored from the CI cache), the build keeps that copy and prints a warning. It fails only when there's nothing to fall back on, or when an allowlisted repository has been deleted or made private: stale copies of those are never published.

A repository's **homepage** setting is linked ("Project site") only if it currently responds; a 4xx/5xx drops the link with a warning, so the site never points at a dead page.

## The allowlist

[`src/data/projects.ts`](src/data/projects.ts) is the only place repositories are defined. Anything not listed there is never fetched or rendered, including repositories created later. `check:allowlist` enforces this on every build. It fails on:

- any `hideouts-io/<repo>` reference to a repo that isn't listed, and
- the name of any repository in the account that isn't listed, plus a fixed never-publish list in [`scripts/check-allowlist.ts`](scripts/check-allowlist.ts).

### Add a repository

1. Make sure the repository is public and its README is ready to publish.
2. Add an entry to `PROJECTS` in `src/data/projects.ts`:

   ```ts
   {
     slug: 'new-tool',             // URL: /apps/new-tool/ or /research/new-tool/
     repo: 'New-Tool',             // exact GitHub repository name
     kind: 'app',                  // 'app' or 'research'
     platforms: ['macOS'],         // 'macOS', 'iOS', 'Windows', 'Linux', 'ChromeOS'
     categories: ['security'],     // apps only; keys of CATEGORIES in projects.ts
     name: 'New Tool',
     tagline: 'One sentence that says why it matters.',
     summary: 'Two sentences for cards, search results, and share previews.',
     highlights: ['Four short', 'feature bullets', 'shown on the', 'app page'],
     traits: ['Read-only'],        // only claims the README actually states
     requires: ['macOS 13 or later'], // as the README states; shown next to the download
     signing: 'Ad-hoc signed · not notarized', // as the README states
     attested: false,              // true if releases carry GitHub build attestations
     order: 9,
   },
   ```

3. Run `npm run content && npm run build && npm run verify` and review the page.

The fields you write by hand (name, tagline, summary, highlights, traits, categories) are the curated layer. Everything else comes from GitHub: description, license, stars, latest release and checksums, last commit date, README, screenshots, logo, and whether the repo has Issues, Discussions, a contributing guide, and private vulnerability reporting.

**Status is never hand-written.** It's derived from releases: no release → "Source only", `v0.x` → "Pre-1.0", `v1.0`+ → "Released", archived repo → "Archived". Maturity notes that a README states explicitly (for example "Early-stage") go in `traits`.

**Categories** (`CATEGORIES` in `projects.ts`) drive the filters on `/apps/`, the category links on the home page, and "Related apps". Only add a category that at least one repository actually fits.

### Hide part of a README: `stripSections`

To leave a README section off the site without changing the README, list its heading text:

```ts
stripSections: ['Repository'],
```

This removes the heading and everything under it, up to the next heading of the same or higher level. The build warns if the heading isn't found.

### How READMEs are adapted

- The title, badge rows, and the README's own table of contents are removed; the site shows its own.
- A `> **Scope:** …` blockquote becomes the page's "Scope & boundaries" panel.
- A logo near the top becomes the app icon.
- GitHub alerts (`> [!NOTE]`, `[!WARNING]`, …) become styled callouts.
- Sections titled "Raw evidence…" and "Direct observation vs. interpretation" become labeled panels.
- Mermaid diagrams become static light and dark SVGs, so no diagram JavaScript runs in the browser.
- Relative links point to GitHub. Links to other allowlisted repos point to their pages on this site.
- HTML is sanitized, and images from anywhere else are dropped.

## Deployment

[`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) builds, checks, and deploys to GitHub Pages.

| Trigger                                  | Deploys?         | External link check |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Push to `main`                           | Yes              | Blocking            |
| Pull request                             | No (checks only) | Blocking            |
| Nightly (06:17 UTC)                      | Yes              | Advisory            |
| `repository_dispatch` (`content-update`) | Yes              | Advisory            |
| Manual (`workflow_dispatch`)             | Yes              | Blocking            |

The nightly run keeps the site in sync with the READMEs. To publish a README change immediately, trigger a dispatch from anywhere with repo access:

```sh
gh api repos/hideouts-io/hideouts.io/dispatches -f event_type=content-update
```

### One-time GitHub setup

1. **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:** GitHub Actions.
2. **Settings → Pages → Custom domain:** `hideouts.io`, then tick **Enforce HTTPS** once the certificate is issued.
3. **Organization/account settings → Pages → Verified domains:** add `hideouts.io` and create the TXT record GitHub shows you. This stops anyone else from claiming the domain on GitHub Pages.

| A     | `@`                                   | `185.199.110.153`                         |
| A     | `@`                                   | `185.199.111.153`                         |

| AAAA  | `@`                                   | `2606:50c0:8002::153`                     |
| AAAA  | `@`                                   | `2606:50c0:8003::153`                     |
| CNAME | `www`                                 | `hideouts-io.github.io`                   |
| TXT   | `_github-pages-challenge-hideouts-io` | _(value shown when verifying the domain)_ |

Remove any other A, AAAA, or CNAME records for `@` and `www`. DNS can take up to 24 hours to propagate. Check it with:

```sh
dig hideouts.io +noall +answer -t A
dig www.hideouts.io +noall +answer -t CNAME
```

Once the records resolve, GitHub issues the HTTPS certificate automatically. Enable **Enforce HTTPS** after that.

## Trust pages

- **[/verify/](https://hideouts.io/verify/)** explains checksums, GitHub build attestations, `codesign`, and opening non-notarized apps. Its release table and attestation example come from GitHub data plus `signing`/`attested` in `projects.ts`.
- App pages show release version, requirements, signing status, and an expandable SHA-256 panel next to the download button.

## Security model

- **Content Security Policy.** Astro emits a `<meta>` CSP with SHA-256 hashes for every script and style. Only `'self'` is allowed for everything else, `frame-src` and `object-src` are `'none'`, and the one extra source is `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, which the Pagefind search index needs to run WebAssembly (it doesn't allow JavaScript `eval`).
- **Inline handlers and inline `style` attributes are blocked by the CSP,** so don't add them. Put behavior in `src/scripts/site.ts` and styling in classes.
- **Framing guard.** GitHub Pages can't send `X-Frame-Options` or a CSP `frame-ancestors` header, so a script in `<head>` ([`Base.astro`](src/layouts/Base.astro)) detects when another site loads a page in a frame, hides the content, shows an "Open hideouts.io" link, and tries to break out to the top window. A frame that disables scripts entirely can get around it; the site has no forms, logins, or actions, so there's nothing to trick a visitor into clicking. For header-level protection, put the site behind Cloudflare (see below).
- **Response headers.** GitHub Pages controls its own headers. [`public/_headers`](public/_headers) holds the full set (HSTS, `frame-ancestors`, `Permissions-Policy`, and more) and applies automatically if the site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. If you keep GitHub Pages but proxy the domain through Cloudflare, add the same headers with a Cloudflare Transform Rule.
- **Vulnerability reports:** see [/security/](https://hideouts.io/security/) and [`/.well-known/security.txt`](public/.well-known/security.txt). Update the `Expires` date in `security.txt` before it lapses (currently 2027-09-24).
